# PHYS488-Proton-Beam-Therapy

#PHYS488 project to simulate proton beam therapy completed by Robert Batty, James Mcloud, Ashley Jones, George Mckevit and Nicholas Cook.

#To Run:
#1. Download libraries used in this model, pixelMed: http://pixelmed.com/dicomtoolkit.html and JDeli: https://www.idrsolutions.com/jdeli/
#2. Place both libraries inside of a folder called "com", this should be in the working directory where you intend to store the java files.
#3. Download all files in this repo.
#4. run "javac RunSimulation.java" in a terminal after navigating to the folder where the java files are stored.
#5. Run the program with "java -Xmx3072m RunSimulation", the -Xmx argument is to manually give java more RAM as it is required to run the simulation
#6. Wait...
