\nTo Run:
\n1. Download libraries used in this model, pixelMed: http://pixelmed.com/dicomtoolkit.html and JDeli: https://www.idrsolutions.com/jdeli/
\n2. Place both libraries inside of a folder called "com", this should be in the working directory where you intend to store the java \nfiles.
\n3. Download all files in this repo.
\n4. run "javac RunSimulation.java" in a terminal after navigating to the folder where the java files are stored.
\n5. Run the program with "java -Xmx3072m RunSimulation", the -Xmx argument is to manually give java more RAM as it is required to run the simulation
\n6. Wait...
